# OpenCode Migration Design

Migration plan for moving Rehor bot instances from Claude Code plus
`claude-agent-sdk` to OpenCode plus its TypeScript SDK. This design also
covers replacing Vertex-authenticated model traffic with an OpenAI-compatible
proxy backed by direct OpenAI API keys.

Status: Proposed

The initial migration slice is preparation only. It changes no tenant routing
or model selection.

Related Jira: `REHOR-35`, `REHOR-60`, `REHOR-68`, `REHOR-91`, `REHOR-92`,
`REHOR-125`, `REHOR-126`, `REHOR-127`, `REHOR-128`

## Decision Summary

- Start one runner-owned OpenCode server per cycle and close it when the cycle ends.
- Create one workspace-scoped client and session per cycle.
- Never share OpenCode servers across bot instances or cycles.
- Keep model credentials in the proxy deployment, not bot pods or OpenCode auth files.
- Add an OpenAI-compatible proxy endpoint backed by direct OpenAI API keys.
- Keep existing Jira, Git, memory, and browser MCP services separate.
- Keep Python preflights during first migration slice; migrate selected hooks to TypeScript plugins later.
- Preserve `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/skills` compatibility during canary migration.

## Current Architecture

```text
bot pod
  Python run.py
    claude-agent-sdk query()
      Claude Code subprocess
        CLAUDE.md + personas + .claude/skills
        MCP: memory, Jira, browser
        HTTP: Vertex proxy, Git proxy, Squid

central proxy pod
  Vertex auth proxy → Vertex AI / Claude models
  Jira MCP proxy
  Git auth proxy
  Executor server
  Squid
```

Current agent entry point is `bot/agent.py`. Preflight scripts are discovered
and executed by `bot/preflight.py`. Deployment and proxy credentials are
defined in `deploy/template.yaml`.

## Target Architecture

```text
bot pod
  TypeScript runner
    AgentRuntime
      OpenCodeRuntime
        V1ServerDriver
          runner-owned child `opencode serve`
          loopback-bound server
          one workspace-scoped client and session per cycle
          SSE events: lifecycle, tool, usage, error
    AGENTS.md / compatible CLAUDE.md
    .opencode/agents, plugins, skills
    MCP: memory, Jira, browser
    HTTP: Rehor model gateway, Git proxy, Squid

central proxy pod
  Rehor model gateway
    Vertex route (legacy/canary)
    OpenAI route (canary/new)
    provider/model allowlist and policy
  Jira MCP proxy
  Git auth proxy
  Executor server
  Squid
```

OpenCode is an agent runtime, not replacement for every existing proxy. The
proxy remains credential and egress boundary. OpenCode remains execution
boundary inside each bot pod.

## Coordinator Boundary

The TypeScript code in `coordinator/` is Rehor's provider-neutral control
plane. It does not replace the Python runner by default, but it now contains
the OpenCode adapter and an opt-in production runner. `BOT_EXECUTION_ENGINE=coordinator`
selects that path; Python remains the rollback/default engine. Both runtimes
implement the same stable boundary.

The coordinator owns run identity, assembled prompt, workspace and provider
attribution, limits, cancellation, normalized event ordering, terminal state,
and usage data. Runtime adapters own SDK-specific server/session lifecycle and
translate SDK messages into Rehor events. SDK objects never cross the
`AgentRuntime` port.

The v1 contract intentionally supports current Python behavior:

- a run carries the label, workflow, fully assembled prompt, provider/model,
  maximum turns, and cycle timeout;
- `task` is nullable because triage starts before a task is selected;
- terminal payloads preserve result text, no-work classification, duration,
  turns, and `CycleContext` fields;
- usage payloads preserve input, output, reasoning, cache-read, and cache-write
  tokens plus cost, including partial usage on interruption;
- preflight `skip` and `error` remain coordinator-owned paths that do not start
  an agent runtime.

See the [coordinator runtime contract](https://github.com/OpenShift-Fleet/rehor/blob/master/coordinator/README.md)
for invariants, compatibility mapping, and development commands.

## OpenCode Server Lifecycle

OpenCode supports runner-owned and client-only modes. The following SDK calls
show the client surface; the production supervisor and adapter live in
`coordinator/src/runtimes/opencode-v1/` and enforce loopback, workspace, version,
configuration-hash, and cleanup checks:

```ts
import { createOpencode } from "@opencode-ai/sdk"

const opencode = await createOpencode({ hostname: "127.0.0.1", port: 4096 })
const client = opencode.client
```

For an already-running server:

```ts
import { createOpencodeClient } from "@opencode-ai/sdk"

const client = createOpencodeClient({
  baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:4096",
})
```

The runner starts one server per cycle as a child process, binds it to loopback,
creates one client with the cycle worktree, and closes the server during cycle
cleanup. A central or persistent shared server is out of scope. OpenCode server
authentication is not a substitute for Rehor task authorization.

## Native TypeScript Runtime Option

[scriptc](https://scriptc.dev/) can compile TypeScript to native executables
that do not require Node, V8, or a JavaScript engine. This is a possible
follow-up optimization for the Rehor runner and standalone preflight tools.

It does not mean the complete OpenCode stack can be compiled immediately:

- The scriptc compiler itself requires Node 24 or newer during image build.
- npm dependencies normally run in scriptc's embedded QuickJS dynamic tier.
- `@opencode-ai/sdk` must pass `scriptc coverage`; static compilation is not assumed.
- OpenCode plugins are loaded and executed by OpenCode's Bun runtime and use Bun's `$` shell API.
- Compiling a plugin as a separate binary does not make it an OpenCode plugin.
- `--dynamic` removes the Node runtime dependency but embeds a JavaScript engine.
- Native networking and HTTP are supported, but SDK behavior, streaming, TLS,
  subprocesses, signals, and filesystem semantics need integration tests.

### Viable Shape

```text
build image
  Node 24 + scriptc → rehor-runner native binary

runtime image
  rehor-runner native binary
  OpenCode official native binary or supported OpenCode runtime
  no Node installation
```

The safest target is a native Rehor runner that connects to an already-running
OpenCode server through HTTP. This avoids compiling OpenCode internals and
keeps plugin loading under its supported runtime. An alternative is compiling
small standalone TypeScript preflight utilities, provided they remain free of
unsupported npm/runtime APIs.

### Acceptance Test Before Adoption

- `scriptc coverage` reports acceptable static coverage for runner entry point.
- `scriptc build` succeeds for target Linux architecture.
- Binary runs without Node or `node_modules`.
- SDK client connects to OpenCode server and completes a session.
- SSE event stream handles long responses and disconnects.
- MCP configuration and tool calls remain functional.
- Signals, timeouts, child processes, Git, and filesystem behavior match current runner.
- Native and normal-runtime runs produce equivalent cycle results and cost data.

Until this test passes, use a supported OpenCode distribution and treat scriptc
as an optimization experiment. Do not make native compilation a dependency of
initial OpenCode migration.

## Direct OpenAI Authentication

OpenAI API requests use HTTP Bearer authentication:

```http
Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY
```

OpenAI recommends loading keys from environment variables or a secret manager,
never client-side code. Rehor should keep keys in Vault and inject them only
into the proxy deployment.

### Preferred Flow

```text
OpenCode in bot pod
  → http://devbot-proxy:8450/v1/chat/completions
     or http://devbot-proxy:8450/v1/responses
  → proxy authenticates bot request
  → proxy validates provider/model
  → proxy adds Authorization: Bearer <OpenAI key>
  → https://api.openai.com (same path, unchanged)
  → streaming response back to OpenCode
```

The bot must not receive `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The OpenCode provider config should
use a bot-to-proxy credential or network policy as its authentication boundary.
If a credential is required, use a separate short-lived proxy token, not the
OpenAI key.

### Implementation Shape

This can reuse the existing Vertex proxy pattern almost directly:

```go
func NewOpenAIProxy(apiKey string, policy *OpenAIPolicy) http.Handler {
    upstream, _ := url.Parse("https://api.openai.com")
    proxy := &httputil.ReverseProxy{
        Rewrite: func(r *httputil.ProxyRequest) {
            r.SetURL(upstream)
            // Client sends /v1/chat/completions; do not prepend /v1 twice.
            r.Out.URL.Path = r.In.URL.Path
            r.Out.URL.RawQuery = r.In.URL.RawQuery
            r.Out.Host = upstream.Host
            r.Out.Header.Set("Authorization", "Bearer "+apiKey)
        },
        FlushInterval:  -1,
        ModifyResponse: stripSensitiveResponseHeaders,
    }
    return policy.Wrap(proxy)
}
```

Required differences from `NewVertexProxy`:

- Read `OPENAI_API_KEY` from proxy environment or secret-backed key provider.
- Ignore and overwrite any incoming `Authorization` header.
- Optionally set configured `OpenAI-Organization` and `OpenAI-Project` headers.
- Validate model from JSON body for `/v1/chat/completions`; URL-only model extraction is insufficient.
- Allow `GET /v1/models` only if proxy returns an allowlisted model catalog.
- Preserve SSE streaming and final usage chunks.
- Add provider-neutral metrics instead of reusing `vertex_model_requests_total`.

Incoming bot authentication remains separate. `Authorization` from OpenCode
must authenticate the bot to Rehor, if used; it must never be forwarded to
OpenAI. Proxy then replaces it with the OpenAI key. NetworkPolicy alone can be
used for a first internal canary, but an authenticated bot-to-proxy request is
preferable before exposing the endpoint beyond the namespace.

This is header injection, not full protocol translation. It works when
OpenCode emits an OpenAI-compatible request. If a future provider requires a
different request or response schema, add an explicit adapter rather than
silently rewriting arbitrary JSON.

### Proxy Endpoint Contract

Initial OpenAI route should support the Chat Completions contract because it is
widely supported by OpenCode's `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` provider, and the
Responses contract because OpenCode's native `@ai-sdk/openai` provider (default
for reasoning models) sends `POST /v1/responses`:

- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `POST /v1/responses`
- `GET /v1/models`
- streaming responses using SSE
- tool calls and tool results
- system/developer/user/assistant/tool messages
- `stream_options.include_usage`
- response usage accounting
- upstream `x-request-id` capture

Proxy requirements:

- Allow only configured model IDs.
- Reject unknown paths, hosts, and models.
- Never log `Authorization`, request contents, prompts, or API keys.
- Strip `Authorization`, `Set-Cookie`, `WWW-Authenticate`, and token-like response headers.
- Preserve streaming; do not buffer full model responses.
- Forward or generate correlation ID using `X-Client-Request-Id`.
- Record provider, model, HTTP status, latency, input tokens, output tokens, and errors.
- Return upstream error class without leaking credentials or secret config.
- Support key rotation without rebuilding bot images.

### OpenCode Provider Configuration

Example bot-side `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "rehor-openai": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "Rehor OpenAI Proxy",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "http://devbot-proxy:8450/v1",
        "apiKey": "{env:REHOR_MODEL_PROXY_TOKEN}"
      },
      "models": {
        "gpt-5.4": { "name": "GPT-5.4" },
        "gpt-5.4-mini": { "name": "GPT-5.4 Mini" },
        "gpt-5.4-nano": { "name": "GPT-5.4 Nano" }
      }
    }
  },
  "model": "rehor-openai/gpt-5.4",
  "small_model": "rehor-openai/gpt-5.4-nano",
  "enabled_providers": ["rehor-openai"],
  "share": "disabled"
}
```

Exact model IDs remain deployment configuration. Do not hardcode model names
until OpenAI account access, pricing, tool support, and regional requirements
are confirmed.

### [REHOR-144](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/REHOR-144) renderer contract

The coordinator's `runtimes/opencode-v1/config.ts` owns the translation from
provider-neutral cycle data to this OpenCode V1 subset. The runtime factory
receives the Python preparation through the `preparedConfig` option on
`executeSelectedRun()` and calls `renderOpenCodeV1ConfigForCycle()` with the
prepared model, allowed tools, optional servers, and `openCodeMcpServers` data.
Deployment-owned
provider/plugin fields remain separate. `mcpServers` and `openCodeMcpServers` are mandatory,
separate bridge views; an absent OpenCode view is a protocol error, never a
fallback to resolved Claude values. The renderer:

- normalizes bare models with the deployment provider ID;
- maps stdio MCP to `local` and HTTP/SSE MCP to `remote`;
- converts Claude-style allowed tools to explicit OpenCode permissions,
  denies unlisted built-ins and configured MCP servers, and skips grants only
  for MCP servers explicitly marked optional by the prepared cycle;
- converts provider/plugin `${VAR}` values to OpenCode `{env:VAR}` references
  only when `VAR` is in the explicit `OPENCODE_PROVIDER_ENVIRONMENT_ALLOWLIST`
  (`REHOR_MODEL_PROXY_TOKEN` today), and returns required variables without
  serializing resolved credentials; MCP URLs may reference only the non-secret
  `JIRA_MCP_URL` endpoint, while MCP headers and local MCP environments cannot
  use environment references;
- rejects unknown tools, malformed transports, untrusted MCP environment
  references, literal credentials, and unpinned package references;
- emits stable JSON, a content hash, and
  `opencode-packages.lock.json` containing every exact provider/plugin package
  version.

The runtime factory renders one immutable snapshot for the selected run and
validates it before constructing the supervisor. `OpenCodeV1Runtime` derives
prompt submission and Rehor event attribution from that same effective
provider/model. The supervisor receives the snapshot in its constructor and
writes the snapshot to a per-cycle config directory,
sets `OPENCODE_CONFIG`, isolates OpenCode's global home/config/database paths,
and enables offline npm resolution plus the pinned runtime's update/download
safeguards. The pinned `1.18.29` release is a tested dependency: its
`OPENCODE_TEST_HOME` behavior is required for per-cycle state isolation. A
version bump must update the supervisor contract tests before the pin changes.
Package installation is not a runtime responsibility: the image
must pre-bake the lockfile closure as part of [REHOR-142](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/REHOR-142).
The default Claude runtime registry and production runtime selection remain
unchanged. Instance configuration now carries independent `runtime` and
`provider` values through the Python bridge as `runtimeId` and `providerId`;
`executeConfiguredRun()` consumes that normalized selection when the future
TypeScript runner is enabled. See the [canary rollout runbook](../operations/rehor-146-opencode-canary.md).

OpenCode receives the generated root `CLAUDE.md` and project `.claude/skills`
through its project discovery path. Persona selection remains in the existing
instruction assembly/preflight boundary; arbitrary global `CLAUDE.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, skills, and plugin configuration are not inherited.

Provider selection remains independent from runtime selection. During canary,
OpenCode may select either the existing Vertex route or the OpenAI gateway
(`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` → Chat Completions, `@ai-sdk/openai` → Responses).
The proxy serves both `POST /v1/chat/completions` and `POST /v1/responses` with
the same header-injection handler; do not translate request schemas inside the
proxy.

## Vertex-to-OpenAI Migration

This is a provider and credential migration, not only a URL change.

### Remove or Retire

- `GOOGLE_SA_KEY_B64` from proxy deployment after rollback window.
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID` and `GCP_REGION` where unused by remaining services.
- `VERTEX_ALLOWED_MODELS` after all Vertex traffic is retired.
- Vertex-specific request translation and token refresh code.
- Vertex-specific dashboards and alerts after equivalent OpenAI metrics exist.

### Add

- Vault key `openai-api-key` or project-scoped equivalent.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` proxy-only environment variable.
- `OPENAI_ALLOWED_MODELS` or provider-neutral model allowlist.
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` with default `https://api.openai.com/v1`.
- `REHOR_MODEL_PROXY_TOKEN` for bot-to-proxy authentication, if required.
- OpenAI request ID and usage metrics.
- OpenAI rate-limit and retry handling.

Do not remove Vertex configuration until canary validation and rollback expiry
complete. During transition, proxy may expose separate provider routes:

```text
:8443  Vertex auth proxy, legacy
:8450  OpenAI-compatible proxy, canary/new path
```

The bot selects provider through OpenCode config. This allows per-instance
rollout without changing central routing for existing Claude-based instances.

## Runtime Migration

### Preparation: Runtime Contract

- Define versioned `RehorRun` and `RehorEvent` schemas.
- Validate the same schemas at runtime and in fixture tests.
- Enforce event identity, sequence, attribution, terminal, and usage invariants.
- Protect the package with Node 22/Vitest tests, typecheck, a Vite Node bundle
  with declaration emit, npm audit, and CI.
- Keep production on `bot/run.py` and `bot/agent.py` until an adapter and
  coordinator loop pass parity tests.

### Phase 1: Compatibility Canary

- Add OpenCode runtime and TypeScript runner beside Python runner.
- Start one OpenCode server per cycle as a runner-owned child process.
- Reuse current MCP endpoints and Git auth proxy.
- Reuse current `CLAUDE.md`, personas, and `.claude/skills`.
- Keep Python preflight scripts unchanged.
- Route model calls through OpenAI-compatible proxy.
- Run one low-risk instance with all other instances unchanged.

### Phase 2: Runner Port

Replace `claude-agent-sdk` usage in `bot/agent.py` with SDK operations:

- create or connect to server
- create session per cycle
- submit prompt
- subscribe to SSE events
- collect assistant text, tool calls, errors, and usage
- abort session on timeout or shutdown
- close server during cycle cleanup and process termination

Project normalized terminal and usage events back into the current
`CycleContext`, status updates, transcript storage, cost posting, turn limits,
and signal handling contracts. During canary, compare these projections with
the Python records for the same fixture scenarios.

### Phase 3: Config and Persona Port

- Add `opencode.json` generation to instance config.
- Map workflow model defaults to `provider/model` IDs.
- Map persona prompts to OpenCode agents or `instructions` files.
- Generate `AGENTS.md` over time; keep `CLAUDE.md` fallback during rollout.
- Map allowed tools to OpenCode `permission` rules.
- Disable session sharing for bot instances.

### Phase 4: Plugin Port

Port only lifecycle behavior that benefits from OpenCode hooks:

- tool policy enforcement
- environment injection
- structured logging
- session lifecycle status
- compaction context
- custom Rehor tools

Keep deterministic, no-LLM preflights and policy decisions outside OpenCode.
Existing preflight contract
(`start`, `skip`, `error`) is already a useful runner boundary.

### Phase 5: Model Tiering

Map current Jira decisions:

| Rehor role | OpenCode configuration |
|---|---|
| Coding | primary agent, full model |
| Reviewer | workflow-specific model |
| Triage | subagent or separate short session |
| Researcher | subagent, standard model |
| Test writer | subagent, standard model |
| Formatter | subagent, cheap model |

Implement after basic session parity. First prove model selection and usage
accounting; then reproduce `REHOR-125` and `REHOR-126` routing.

## Security Model

- OpenAI key exists only in proxy pod memory.
- Bot pod gets no OpenAI key and no Google service-account key.
- OpenCode server binds to loopback or pod-local interface.
- NetworkPolicy permits bot → model proxy only on required port.
- Server authentication is enabled if any non-loopback access exists.
- `share` is disabled for autonomous bot sessions.
- OpenCode permissions explicitly deny unnecessary tools and providers.
- Proxy validates model and provider instead of trusting bot config.
- Proxy strips credential-bearing response headers.
- Prompt, tool arguments, and model output stay out of proxy logs by default.
- Separate bot instances use separate OpenCode servers and worktrees.

## Observability

Preserve existing Rehor metric dimensions and add provider dimensions:

- `provider`
- `model`
- `instance_id`
- `workflow`
- `status`
- `run_id`

Required measurements:

- OpenCode server health and version
- session creation and completion
- session aborts and timeouts
- MCP connection status
- model request count and status
- model latency and stream interruption
- input/output/reasoning tokens when available
- estimated cost by provider and model
- proxy rate-limit responses
- preflight duration and outcome

Do not assume OpenAI streaming always includes final usage. Store partial-cycle
records and mark usage incomplete when stream terminates before final usage
event.

## Validation and Rollback

Canary acceptance criteria:

- One ticket completes from preflight through PR.
- Jira, GitHub/GitLab, memory, browser, and Slack paths work.
- Tool calls execute with equivalent permissions.
- OpenAI proxy never exposes API key to bot.
- Streaming survives long responses.
- Usage and cost data reaches dashboard.
- No credential-bearing response headers reach bot.
- Merge rate and CI pass rate are not worse than Claude baseline.
- p95 cycle duration does not regress materially.
- Model allowlist rejects unapproved IDs.

Rollback:

1. Switch instance model config back to Vertex provider.
2. Restart affected bot deployment.
3. Leave OpenAI proxy and key intact for investigation.
4. Compare OpenCode transcript, proxy metrics, and Claude baseline.
5. Remove OpenCode runtime only after root cause is known.

## Open Questions

- Which OpenAI project owns production keys and spending limits?
- Should proxy authenticate bots with service-account identity, mTLS, or a namespace-scoped token?
- Does selected OpenAI model support required tool-call and vision behavior?
- Is OpenAI data retention policy acceptable for Rehor ticket and source-code data?
- Do regional or organizational restrictions require a different OpenAI endpoint?
- ~~Should proxy support Responses API later, or standardize on Chat Completions first?~~ Served: both `POST /v1/chat/completions` and `POST /v1/responses`.
- Which existing cost fields map reliably to OpenAI usage fields?
- Should a future persistent-volume design support server reuse across cycles?
