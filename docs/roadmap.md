# Rehor Roadmap

Planned improvements and new capabilities for the Rehor autonomous development platform. Items are listed by theme, not priority order.

---

## 1. Shared Memory MCP Server

Expose the memory server as a read-only MCP endpoint that engineers can connect to from their local Claude Code, Cursor, or other agentic tool sessions.

**Why:** Bot instances accumulate valuable knowledge — repo conventions, API quirks, deployment gotchas, common failure patterns. All instances already share a global long-term memory server, but that knowledge is only accessible to bot sessions. A read-only MCP endpoint lets any engineer query it from their own tools: "What did the bot learn about this repo's test setup?" or "What CI issues have been seen in this project?"

**Scope:**
- Read-only MCP access to the shared memory store
- MCP resource endpoints for browsing memories by instance, type, and topic
- MCP tool for semantic search across all memories
- Authentication via existing platform identity
- Documentation for connecting from local Claude Code / Cursor / OpenCode

**Future:** Enable write access from local sessions so engineers can contribute knowledge back to the shared memory (e.g., document a fix the bot should learn from).

## 2. Instance Onboarding Agent

A dedicated bot instance that automates onboarding new teams and repos onto the platform.

**Why:** Today, onboarding a new instance requires manual setup — creating config files, Jira labels, Konflux components, and repo permissions. An onboarding agent can handle the mechanical steps while maintaining a conversation with the requester across Jira comments, PR reviews, and other channels to gather requirements and iterate on the configuration.

**How it works:**
- Triggered by a new Jira issue (e.g., "Onboard repo X to Rehor")
- Engages in a multi-channel dialog with the reporter (Jira comments, PRs) to gather details:
  - Repository URL and hosting platform (GitHub / GitLab)
  - Jira project and board
  - Workflow type (scrum, kanban, etc.)
  - Team and reviewer preferences
  - Any special build or test requirements
- Generates the instance configuration (env preset, workflow, CLAUDE.md)
- Opens a PR to add the new instance to the fleet
- Validates the setup with a dry-run preflight

---

## 3. Instance Improvement Agent

A meta-agent that analyzes bot instance performance and opens PRs to improve the platform.

**Why:** The primary goals are cost reduction and quality improvement. Bot instances generate rich signal — transcripts, preflight logs, token usage, success/failure patterns. A dedicated agent can mine this data to find systematic improvements that would be tedious for humans to extract manually.

**What it does:**
- Reviews instance transcripts to find recurring patterns, issues, and inefficiencies
- Identifies repetitive task sequences that should become skills
- Detects preflight gaps (tickets that start but shouldn't have)
- Analyzes feedback patterns (repeated human corrections → instruction updates)
- Opens PRs with concrete improvements:
  - New or refined preflight checks
  - New skills for repetitive task patterns
  - Updated CLAUDE.md instructions based on feedback trends
  - Workflow optimizations

---

## 4. Additional Workflow Presets

Expand the workflow preset library beyond the current scrum-based Jira workflow.

**Planned presets:**
- **jira-kanban** — Continuous flow workflow without sprints. Pull from backlog by priority, no sprint boundaries.
- **github-issues** — For teams that use GitHub Issues instead of Jira. Poll issues by label, manage project boards.
- **gitlab-issues** — Same concept for GitLab-native teams.
- **maintenance-only** — No ticket work. Focused entirely on dependency updates, CI fixes, and PR maintenance across a set of repos.
- **review-bot** — Dedicated to code review. Watches for PRs on configured repos, provides review feedback, and verifies fixes.

Each preset includes its own workflow CLAUDE.md, preflight checks, and default configuration.

## 5. Agentic SDLC Integration

Integrate with the [Fleet Engineering Agentic SDLC](https://github.com/OpenShift-Fleet/agentic-sdlc) tooling — a shared skill and command catalog used across the organization.

**Why:** The agentic-sdlc repo provides battle-tested skills (`start-work`, `finish-work`, `pr-review`, `jira-create`, etc.) and SDLC practices that the broader engineering org already uses. Aligning Rehor with these standards means bot instances follow the same workflows human engineers do, and improvements flow both ways.

**Integration points:**
- Install the agentic-sdlc plugin into bot runner images so skills are available at runtime
- Align bot workflows with SDLC practices (e.g., `start-work` / `finish-work` lifecycle)
- Use shared Jira skills (`jira-create`, `story-specialist`, `bug-specialist`) instead of custom implementations
- Adopt `pr-review` and `scored-code-review` for bot self-review before opening PRs
- Contribute bot-specific skills back upstream (e.g., preflight patterns, autonomous loop management)
- Keep skill versions in sync — pin to releases, auto-update via Konflux

---

## 6. Model Customization & Cost Tiering

Configure which AI models are used for different tasks and workflows, matching model capability to task complexity.

**Why:** Not every task needs the most capable (and expensive) model. Status checks, label management, simple PR maintenance, and boilerplate generation can run on smaller, cheaper models without any quality loss. Reserving top-tier models for complex implementation work can significantly reduce per-instance cost while maintaining output quality where it matters.

**Scope:**
- **Per-workflow model configuration** — allow workflow presets to specify a default model tier. A maintenance-only workflow or a review-bot can default to a cheaper model than a full implementation workflow.
- **Per-task model selection** — within a single session, use cheaper models for mechanical sub-tasks (status checks, formatting, label updates, commit message generation) and escalate to stronger models for design decisions, complex bug fixes, or multi-file refactors.
- **Sub-agent model tiers** — when the main agent spawns sub-agents (e.g., for parallel research, file scanning, test generation), those sub-agents can run on cheaper models since they handle scoped, well-defined tasks.
- **Model routing rules** — configurable rules in instance or workflow config that map task types to model tiers (e.g., `preflight: haiku`, `implementation: sonnet`, `architecture: opus`).
- **Cost tracking per model tier** — break down token spend by model in instance metrics to measure savings and validate routing decisions.

**Examples:**
- A preflight check agent that just reads PR status and Jira state → cheapest available model
- A sub-agent grepping for patterns across a repo → cheap model
- The main loop deciding which ticket to work on → mid-tier model
- Implementing a multi-file feature from a Jira story → top-tier model
